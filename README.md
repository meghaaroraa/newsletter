# Newsletter

The newsletter signup application, developed using Node.js and Express.js with integration of the Mailchimp API, provides a seamless way for users to subscribe to a newsletter mailing list. The application collects the user's name and email address, allowing them to sign up and receive updates, promotions, or other relevant content. The user's information is securely captured and transmitted to the Mailchimp API, which then adds the user to the designated mailing list. This application facilitates effective communication between the organization or individual running the newsletter and their subscribers, ensuring that users stay informed and engaged with the latest updates and offerings.
